Every decade rewrites the rules of eyebrow beauty. The 90s loved
pencil-thin, overplucked arches. The early 2000s brought rounded,
minimal brows. And now? Thick, defined brows are the standard of modern
beauty. But what happens if your natural brows are light, sparse, or
just don't frame your face the way you'd like?

What Is Brow Tinting?
---------------------

Eyebrow tinting is a semi-permanent treatment that uses specially
formulated dye to enhance the color, shape, and fullness of your brows.
Whether you're looking to subtly deepen your natural color or go bolder
to match a new hair color, tinting can help create that well-defined,
polished look without makeup.

The tint typically lasts **4 to 6 weeks**, depending on your hair type
and aftercare. Perfect for busy professionals, active lifestyles, or
anyone wanting a low-maintenance beauty routine.
