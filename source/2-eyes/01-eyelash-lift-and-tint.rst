An eyelash lift and tint is a beauty treatment that enhances the
appearance of your natural eyelashes by curling and darkening them.

**Eyelash lift** – A semi-permanent treatment that uses a perming
solution and curling rod to curl your lashes from the base to the tip.
This gives your lashes a more open, lifted look and can make them appear
longer and brighter.

**Eyelash tint** – An artificial dye that darkens your lashes to give
them a fuller, more dramatic look.

The results of an eyelash lift and tint can last for up to six weeks,
depending on how quickly your lashes grow. The treatment is generally
safe when performed by a licensed professional, but there are potential
risks, such as skin irritation or allergies.

Some recommend pairing an eyelash lift and tint with an eyebrow tint to
frame your face. You can also use a lash growth serum to help your
lashes grow longer.
