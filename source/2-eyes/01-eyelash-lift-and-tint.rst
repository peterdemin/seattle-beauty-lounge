What Is a Lash Lift & Tint?
---------------------------

An eyelash lift and tint is a beauty treatment that curls and darkens
natural eyelashes to enhance their appearance.

A **lash lift** works like a perm for your eyelashes, giving them a
gentle, lasting curl. Your master esthetician customizes the curl based
on your lash length and desired look, ranging from subtle and natural to
bold and dramatic.

A **lash tint** is a semi-permanent dye that darkens your lashes, making
them look fuller and more defined, perfect for anyone with blonde, red,
or light-colored lashes.

When combined, a lash lift and tint can make your eyes pop without any
makeup. Results typically last 6–8 weeks, depending on your natural lash
cycle and aftercare.

What To Expect
--------------

.. _h.ae3ix7smbid3:

**Consultation**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before your first lash lift and tint, your master esthetician will meet
with you to discuss your goals, lifestyle, and any sensitivities. We'll
evaluate your lash length and condition to determine the best approach
and curl for your unique features.

.. _h.f4k3ih44upkr:

**Treatment Process**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please arrive with clean, makeup-free lashes. The entire treatment takes
about an hour. Here's what happens:

#. We clean your lashes and eye area.
#. A silicone pad is placed on the upper lid.
#. Your lashes are gently curled over the pad and set with a lifting
   solution.
#. We apply a tint to darken and define.
#. After setting, we remove the solutions and pads to reveal lifted,
   tinted lashes.

Your eyes stay closed for most of the procedure, and you’ll feel nothing
more than light pressure or tugging.

Aftercare & Longevity
---------------------

**For the first 24–48 hours, follow these aftercare tips:**

-  Avoid getting your lashes wet (no water, steam, or sweating)
-  Don’t apply mascara, makeup, or skincare around the eyes
-  Avoid rubbing or touching your lashes
-  Sleep on your back the first night
-  No facials, lash curlers, or additional eye treatments

After the initial window, you can return to your routine, including
makeup and skincare. Results last 6–8 weeks, depending on your lash
growth cycle.

Who’s a Good Candidate?
-----------------------

Lash lifts and tints work best for those with medium to long lashes. If
your lashes are very short, we may recommend an alternative or give
guidance on strengthening treatments first. It’s also ideal for anyone
looking for a low-maintenance beauty routine with lasting results.
