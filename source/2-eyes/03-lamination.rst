What is Brow Lamination?
------------------------

Think of it as a perm—but for your brows. Brow lamination restructures
the direction of your natural brow hairs using a gentle two-step
solution. The result? Lifted, fuller, and neatly aligned brows that stay
in place without the need for daily styling.

The term “lamination” refers to the use of plastic wrap during the
setting phase, which helps the product work more effectively and shapes
the brows in the desired direction.

Aftercare Tips
--------------

For the first 24 hours after your brow lamination:

-  Avoid getting your brows wet
-  Skip makeup and heavy skincare on the area
-  Avoid steam, heat, or sun exposure
-  Do not apply oils or exfoliants

Keeping your brows hydrated with a nourishing brow serum after 24 hours
can help maintain softness and flexibility.

Many clients choose to combine **lamination and tint** for a truly
transformative result.
