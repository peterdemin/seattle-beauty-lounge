esthetician and permanent makeup artist, we blend science, technique,
and artistry in every treatment.

Our specialties include:

   barrier-repair and deep cleansing, our custom facials — including the
   signature Glass Skin Facial, BioRePeel, and traditional European
   facials—restore balance, radiance, and skin health.
-  Lash Lift & Tint – Enjoy beautifully lifted, darkened lashes for a
   natural, wide-eyed look without needing mascara or extensions.

   to enhance your natural symmetry and facial features.
