What is ProCell Microchanneling MD?
-----------------------------------

Procell Microchanneling enhances cellular activity by creating thousands
of microchannels. Each channel prompts an inflammatory response,
initiating collagen formation. Over time, this repeated healing process,
amplified by our clinically proven growth factor serums derived from
stem cells, significantly improves skin texture and overall appearance,
rejuvenating the skin effectively. Procell Microchanneling stimulates
cellular activity through the creation of thousands of
microchannels. This process triggers an inflammatory response, leading
to the formation of new collagen. With repeated treatments, this natural
healing is enhanced by clinically proven stem cell-derived growth factor
serums, resulting in significant improvements to skin texture and
overall appearance, effectively rejuvenating the skin.

**How Procell Microchanneling Works:**

This minimally invasive, non-surgical, and non-ablative procedure
preserves the epidermis while creating microchannels. Unlike
microneedling, it avoids scratching or tearing the skin, thus
eliminating the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The
microchannels stimulate the skin's healing response, producing new
collagen and enhanced absorption of cosmeceutical serums and
creams. This award-winning treatment thickens the epidermis.
