The Purifying Facial for Congested, Dull Skin is a specialized skincare
treatment tailored to reduce and prevent acne breakouts. Unlike a basic
facial, this treatment focuses on purifying congested pores, reducing
inflammation, and minimizing future breakouts with active ingredients
and professional techniques. Each facial is customized based on your
current skin condition, whether you’re experiencing blackheads,
whiteheads, cystic acne, or post-acne marks.

Why Professional Acne Care Matters
----------------------------------

Unlike over-the-counter treatments that often dry out or irritate the
skin, a professional Acne Facial uses high-quality, targeted products
and techniques to treat acne without causing additional damage. Our goal
is to restore balance, support your skin barrier, and give you the
confidence of clearer, healthier skin.

For best results, acne facials may be recommended in a series,
especially if you are actively breaking out. We also combine our
treatments with education on skincare habits, home care products, and
lifestyle tips to support long-term skin health.
