What Is a Back Facial?
----------------------

A **Back Facial** is a therapeutic skincare treatment that applies the
same principles as a regular facial — cleansing, exfoliation,
extraction, hydration, and treatment—only it’s designed for the unique
needs of the back. Because this area tends to be thicker and oilier, it
requires a deeper level of care to effectively target congestion and
irritation.

Our Back Facial begins with **gentle steaming,** which opens the pores
and softens impurities for easier cleansing and extraction. A **deep
cleansing** follows to remove sweat, oil, and dirt buildup. Then, an
**exfoliation process** sloughs off dead skin cells to encourage renewal
and smoothness. For those dealing with back acne or blemishes, a
**targeted acne treatment** is applied to calm inflammation and purify
the skin.

To complete the treatment, a **soothing mask** is used to hydrate and
calm the skin, followed by a **moisturizing finish** that locks in
hydration and nourishment.
